      Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA
      standard</a>. </p>
    <p>This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 AA standard, due to
      the non-compliances
      listed below. </p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content </h2>
    <p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons. </p>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
    <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
      <li>There is no timeout warning on pages within the service. This could make it more difficult for users who need
        more time to complete a task as they will have no indication that the service is going to time out. This fails
        WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.2.1 - 2.2.6 (Enough time). We plan to fix this by December 2026.
      </li>
      <li>Some error messages are not attached to the fields they relate to in the service. This means when navigating
        the page with assistive technology, the fields don’t show an error associated with them. This fails WCAG 2.2
        success criterion 3.3.1 - 3.3.6 (Input assistance). We plan to fix this by December 2026.
      </li>
      <li>Some of the back links lead to pages that are unexpected. This could cause people to get lost in the service.
        This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.4.1 (Bypass blocks). We plan to fix this by December 2026.
      </li>
    </ol>
