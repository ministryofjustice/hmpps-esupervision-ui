      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h3>
      <p>
        The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public
        Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Compliance status</h2>
      <p>
        The website has been tested against the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/" class="govuk-link"
          >Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA standard</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 AA standard, due
        to the non-compliances listed below.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content</h2>
      <p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>
          On some pages, the skip to main content link retains on the next page, which could lead assistive technology
          users to miss information. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.4.1 (bypass blocks). We plan to fix this by
          November 2025.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some images have alt text that is not descriptive. This means some users will not get the context of the
          image. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content). We plan to fix this by November 2025.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is the need for probation practitioners to compare the likeness of an individual using sight only. This
          fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.3.3 (sensory characteristics). There is no current workaround for this.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h2>
      <p>We have no content outside the scope of accessibility regulations.</p>
